### Capstone Project - for the PGP DSBA program offered by Great Learning

Problem Summary:
A leading e-commerce company wishes to be able to predict which of their customers are likely to churn, so as to be able to take suitable measures to prevent the customers from leaving.

The given dataset contains attributes of the company’s customers, and aspects of their behaviour on the company’s e-commerce website and app:
- The records contain demographic details, such as gender, age, marital status, address etc. 
- The records also reflect the customer’s buying behaviour such as their preferred category, preferred login device, frequency of purchase, recency of transaction, satisfaction scores etc.

There are 5630 unique customer records, and 20 features per record, in the dataset.

The objective of the capstone project is to:
- mine patterns in the customer data and 
- analyse what factors typically lead to customer churn, and 
- build a model that will predict churn based on the important features thus identified.

The final Project Report, Presentation, and the Notebooks with the analysis are a part of the repository.
